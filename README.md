## Project Overview 

This project performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews of all London branches of Simmons Bar, collected from Google Maps. Unlike a previous study where VADER and DistilBERT were tested on 12 independent restaurants, this project focuses on a single brand across multiple locations, providing deeper insights into branch-level performance and customer perception.

A total of 33,000+ real customer reviews were scraped using Apify and Outscraper, making this dataset significantly larger and more representative. The analysis leverages state-of-the-art transformer models (RoBERTa and DeBERTa) to classify reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments with improved accuracy over traditional lexicon-based or lightweight transformer models.

The results are aggregated to:

- Measure branch-specific sentiment distribution.

- Compare positive sentiment ratios across branches.

- Highlight strengths and weaknesses of each branch relative to competitors.

An interactive web application was also developed to visualize branch-level sentiment and geographical insights.
